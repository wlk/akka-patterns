This repo is a demo implementation of few akka patterns I stumbled upon.

More information about each pattern is at the top of it's scala source file. To gain most from this repo, you should study the implementation closely.

## Extra

This pattern can be used to help with aggregating responses from downstream actors in a non blocking fashion (without using ask pattern). More information about it can be found in [Effective Akka](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028789.do) book by Jamie Allen
Something similar can be found in "Functional Programming in Scala" (pages 118-119)

### Contributing

This is by no means a complete directory of akka patterns, so contributions are always welcome.
